# Abstract Syntax Tree #

Metachatr's abstract syntax tree (AST) is very LISP like, but is based on JSON data structures instead of lists.

The simplest form is the s-expression. This mimics exactly what LISP does.

    ["echo", "Hello"]

These can be nested.

    ["echo",
        ["+", 2, 3]]

In an s-expression the first element in the list is the function name that is to be called and the remaining items are taken as the function's arguments.
